I am trying to answer the below questions:

1) Highest number of earthquakes occurrences classified yearly?
2) Locations with the highest number of earthquakes occurrences?
3) Classification based on magnitude values?
4) Classification based on magnitude types?
5) Severity of the earthquakes vs count?
