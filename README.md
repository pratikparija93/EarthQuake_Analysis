# EarthQuake_Analysis

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/usgs/earthquake-database

I am trying to answer the below questions:

Exploratory Data Analysis

1) Highest number of earthquakes occurrences classified yearly?
2) Locations with the highest number of earthquakes occurrences?
3) Classification based on magnitude values?
4) Classification based on magnitude types?
5) Severity of the earthquakes vs count?


Clustering

1) Do the clustering methods generate the same clusters?
2) Does scaling effect the clustering?
3) Does the clustering produce interesting groupings?


Linear Regression

1) Is the relationship significant?
2) Are any model assumptions violated?
3) Is there any multi-colinearity in the model?
4) In the multiple regression models are predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?
5) Does the model make sense?
6) Cross-validate the model. How well did it do?
7) Does regularization help with creating models that validate better on out of sample data?


Logistic Regression: In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that contains data coded as 1 (yes, success, etc.) or 0 (no, failure, etc.). In other words, the logistic regression model predicts P(Y=1) as a function of X.

1) Is the relationship significant?
2) Are any model assumptions violated?
3) How well is the cross-validation accuracy?
